This type of functions is basically for the operating system development. It is not going to be
useful in application development. So you can omit them if you want. But definately check out 
64-bit version of AsmFun. It's incredible!

Here's a list of 16-bit asm functions for your system development pleasure:

1. _readFromDisk
	Purpose:
		Loads ax sectors to es:bx from dl drive starting
		from the second sector.

	Input:
		- ax as the number of sectors

		- es:bx as the memory location to read the data to

		- dl as the disk drive number

	Output:
		- ah is modified

		- cx is modified

		- si is modified

		- dh is modified
	
		- di is modified
    
        - bios also can modify registers

	Dependencies:
		%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/ReadFromDisk/main.asm"

2. GDTLM
		Purpose:
			This is the pointer to Global Descriptor Table for switching to
			Long Mode. 
		
		Dependencies:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/GDTLM/main.asm"

3. _newLine:
	Purpose:
		Moves the screen cursor to the next line utilizing the bios interrupt 0x10.

	Input:
		- dh is a current page

	Output:
		- ah is equal to 02h
	
		- dl is equal to 0
	
		- dh is incremented

        - bios also can modify registers

	Dependencies:
		%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/NewLine/main.asm"

4. _print:
	Purpose:
		Prints a line to the screen

	Input:
		- si is a pointer to screen
	
	Output:
        - ax is modified

        - si is modified

        - bios also can modify registers

	Dependencies:
		%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/Print/main.asm"

5. _switchToLM
        Purpose:
            Prepares system to switch to Long Mode and makes the switch.

        Input:	
            - nothing 
        
        Output:
            - eax is modified

            - ebx is modified

            - ecx is modified

            - edi is modified

            - cr0 is modified

            - cr3 is modified

            - cr4 is modified

            - msr is modified

            - gdtr is modified

            - if is modified

        Dependencies:
            %include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/SwitchToLM/main.asm"

6. _waitForKeyAndReboot:
	Purpose:
		Waits for user key enter and reboots the system

	Input:
		- nothing

	Output:
		- nothing

	Dependencies:
		%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/WaitForKeyAndReboot/main.asm"
